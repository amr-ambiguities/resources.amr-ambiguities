This repository contains the resources of a paper "  Dealing with Natural Language Ambiguities using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)"


We focus on the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) ability to represent lexical and syn-tactic ambiguities in generation and parsing. 
As a first step, we have created a corpus of purpo-sely ambiguous sentences in English with a reference AMR representation validated by human annotators.
These reference AMRs were used as input to three AMR generators to generate sentences in English to be compared with the references according to their type of ambiguity.
The reference sentences were processed by three AMR parsers that were compared with the original AMR.
This experiment allows us to analyze the ability of AMR to deal with lexical and syntactic ambiguities in generation and parsing.
In this repository, we present the corpus of our study consists of fifteen statements that present lexical and syntactic ambiguities.
